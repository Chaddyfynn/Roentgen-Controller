# Roentgen X-RAY Machine Controller
This is currently a personal project.  The controller is a GUI for a home x-ray scanner that runs on a USB GPIO board.
The aim for the project is to fully develop a hobby software for controlling a hobby device.

## Release
There are currently NO public releases of this yet.  Future development may lead to a free release for 64-bit Windows systems with documentation provided for control using a USB GPIO board.
